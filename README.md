# Simple-Search-Engine
Just a Simple Search Engine 

The Search Engine reads the data from the text file and based on queries returns the lines where the data can be found.
The file is taken as a command-line argument, for example --data text.txt, where 'text.txt' is file name with extension.
The Search Engine queries data depending on the strategy/behavior chosen, as the project is based on the Strategy design pattern. 

The idea of the project was taken from the JetBrains Hyperskill education platform!
